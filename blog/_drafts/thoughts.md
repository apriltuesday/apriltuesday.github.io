Miscellaneous thoughts

## Thoughts
* UPenn work
    * duration common sense reasoning from text – knowing duration of verb applied to obj can reveal properties of the obj
    * text simplification (seq2seq)
    * targeted summarisation – Amazon barcelona long text summaries about characters in book, etc.
* NLI as minimal task for understanding without grounding (how would you prove this)
