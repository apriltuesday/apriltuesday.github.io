Miscellaneous thoughts

## Thoughts
* UPenn work
    * duration common sense reasoning from text – knowing duration of verb applied to obj can reveal properties of the obj
    * text simplification (seq2seq)
    * targeted summarisation – Amazon barcelona long text summaries about characters in book, etc.
* NLI as minimal task for understanding without grounding (how would you prove this)
* this actually feels like an academic conference and not a big industrial recruiting event, it's actually really really nice – everyone is friendlier

## Posters of interest
* https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.01587
* https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.03122

## People's comments on the poster
* try on languages with different characteristics, e.g. morphology, to understand more what vectors are using
* disentangle effect of dataset vs. algorithm in what causes outliers etc.
