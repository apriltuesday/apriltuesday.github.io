Part of my series of notes from [ICLR 2019](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2019) in New Orleans.

## Introduction
* big picture ethical issues in physics vs. computer science.... :facepalm:
* some background on Zeynep, including experiencing the power of the internet, etc.
* lots of power and potential, but might be sleepwalking into dangers

## Themes
* You are part of this world.
* These tools won't be used the way you think they will be.
* Alternative paths are possible.

## Challenges
* Facebook news feed – optimised to keep people engaged
    * using ML algorithms but business model incentives certain kinds of information spreading more than others
* recommender systems – people who like one conspiracy theory often like others
    * relatively innocent conspiracy theories can escalate to more dangerous ones
    * "you're never hardcore enough for youtube"
    * more engagement == success, but how?
* interpretability & bias are relatively commonly talked about
* potency-at-scale restructuring power
    * might not know your model is doing certain problematic things
    * for some people, if they get scared, they tend to vote for authoritarians
* can we get early intervention without mass surveillance?

## What do we do?
* if you build it, people in power will use it, and not necessarily for what you want
* "if I don't build it, someone else will" – maybe so, but at least it won't be *you* building it
* there *are* alternative ways of doing things, they're just harder
    * privacy-preserving, etc.
* by choosing what we work on, we can drive the direction companies take
* what do we do?
    * organize – have a voice
    * build alternatives
* "I have a feeling I won't be invited back... not with these sponsors"

## Q&A
* refusal is powerful, but we need alternatives
* product people should team up with people on the security side
* if you collect the data, people *will* come for it
    * there's no historical precendent for anything else
