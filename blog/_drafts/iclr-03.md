Part of my series of notes from [ICLR 2019](https://iclr.cc/Conferences/2019) in New Orleans.
I missed the beginning of this one and had a little trouble catching up, so the first part of these notes kind of doesn't make any sense... sorry about that.

## The First Bit
* multiple datasets for same phenomenon but exhibiting potentially different biases
* learning real phenomenon without spurious correlations in dataset
* nature doesn't shuffle examples, we do
    * ...so maybe we shouldn't
* robust regression
    * interpolation in the convex hull of seen training environs
* but is interpolation enough
* stable properties across environments?
* invariant regression
    * extrapolation rather than just interpolation
* design function family that is insensitve to spurious correlations

* invariant representations
    - find relevant variables - so that regression is invariant
* related work
    * invariance and causation - properties that are invariant after intervention
    * adversarial domain adaptation

## Invariant Regularization
* method corresponds to inserting frozen domain adaptation layer
* make the representation good enough that I don't have to learn a different adaptation layer for each domain
* show this works on "colored MNIST"
    * 2 datasets, engineered to have misleading information, but in different ways
    * invariant regularization helps model perform well even when test set is perversely chosen to be quite different
* issues scaling it up
    * numerical issues
    * realizable problems work differently (from colored MNIST)
* phenomenon (pre-label) vs. interpretation (post-label, i.e. annotation)
    * supervised - designed to be realizable, labelling supposed to be deterministic 
    * unsupervised - label comes from nature, not necessarily realizable
