Part of my series of notes from [NAACL-HLT 2019](https://naacl2019.org/) in Minneapolis.

## What is a product?
* and how do you know when a product is done?
    * the most academic answer: it's never done
        * you keep working on it forever and sometimes you fork it to show people
    * the most corporate answer: it's done when **people will pay for it**
* a product is a thing that people pay for
* a product has to keep a promise

## Chapter 1: Academia
* very linguistics-y – "as far as possible from anything I'm doing now"
* the seeds of **data ethics** principles
    * people have to know you're collecting data, and for whom
    * you have to use it for their benefit

* in many ways, a dissertation is kind of like a product
    * it's good when it's done
    * it's done when you've published

## Chapter 2: Industry
* computational linguist at Microsoft
* worked on sorting algorithms for non-Latin languages
    * this suddenly became very relevant and very urgent after the 2004 tsunami
    * made decisions that became official without necessarily having any contact with the community or the appropriate linguistic qualifications

* learned about **prioritising user experience**, making tradeoffs
    * e.g. spellchecking – what if you could catch 80% of the errors in 20% of the time?
* how do you behave ethically and humanely for a billion people?
    * can't be based on personal relationships anymore
    * I think this is really important to think about, and not addressed by enough people

## Chapter 3: Textio
* language is fascinating, complicated, and constantly changing
* **learning loops**
    * used to be data creating product
    * now it's product creating data (creating product creating data...)

![jobs](/assets/images/2019-naacl/jobs.jpg "jobs")

* [Textio](https://textio.com/) live demo
    * mainly targeted at recruitment for now
    * not just editing but **generation** (quite impressive!)
* learning loop involves predicting, suggesting, and creating
* "you can't do this with an unexplainable model"
    * but also "just use what works", the product doesn't care about your theoretical biases
    * I don't get this :thinking:
* helping companies learn about themselves and embody the values they want
    * fill roles faster and be more unbiased
    * these really do go together, that's just math
* rule-driven vs. data-driven – sometimes make an **editorial choice** for the former because of the world we want to create

## Three principles of data ethics for the learning loop era
1. No surprises – make it clear you're collecting data
2. Use data the way you say you are – don't sell or share
3. Use data for the benefit of those who provided it
