Here's all my notes from [NAACL-HLT 2019](https://naacl2019.org/)!
Not present are all the fascinating conversations I had with random people, mostly over breakfast. :pancakes:

(I don't know what it is about breakfast!  My theory is that it's because everyone is undercaffeinated and hence both more humble about their own work and less self-conscious about asking dumb questions, but someone should seriously do a study on this.)


#### Sunday (tutorials)
* [Deep Adversarial Learning for NLP](https://www.april.sh/blog/2019/06/02/adversarial)
* [Transfer Learning in NLP](https://www.april.sh/blog/2019/06/02/transfer)

#### Tuesday
* [Industry Track](https://www.april.sh/blog/2019/06/04/industry) on Alexa (seriously), and IE from dialogues and visual documents 
* [Semantics Track](https://www.april.sh/blog/2019/06/04/semantics), which in this case seemed like a bit of all catch-all (I guess semantics is the bit of language that isn't the other stuff)
