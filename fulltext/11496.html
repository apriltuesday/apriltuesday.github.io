    <p>BRUSSELS &#8212; Greece faced increased pressure Tuesday over its use of complex financial instruments to mask its rising debt, with European officials demanding detailed explanations by the end of the week and saying they could extend their inquiry to other countries.</p>

 <p>The announcement came at the end of a meeting of European Union finance ministers in Brussels, a gathering that threatened Athens with further austerity measures unless it proves within a month that its deficit reduction program is working.</p><p>A crisis of confidence in the financial markets over Greece&#8217;s huge public deficit and high debt levels has prompted the biggest test for the European single currency since its inception.</p><p>The finance ministers on Tuesday told Greece that it will have to show by March 16 that spending cuts it is planning can bring its deficit down from 12.7 percent of gross domestic product, to 8.7 percent this year.</p><p>The ministers warned Athens &#8212; which already faces a wave of strikes &#8212; to ready itself for additional cuts in case a verification mission finds that the Greek austerity program is insufficient to achieve the targets set.</p><p>Though E.U. leaders promised last week to take determined and coordinated action to defend the euro if necessary, there was no public discussion Tuesday on what form that could take.</p><p>Ireland&#8217;s finance minister, Brian Lenihan, said that the 16 euro zone finance ministers had agreed &#8220;that we will not talk about what the instruments are. We believe that would be unwise.&#8221;</p><p>On Tuesday, the European commissioner for economic and monetary affairs, Olli Rehn, moved forward a deadline for Athens to give its explanation of the use of sophisticated financial instruments that concealed the scale of the deficit. The use of such instruments was first reported in The New York Times. </p><p>The deadline, which the European Commission said Monday night had been set for the end of the month, would be set for the end of this week, Mr. Rehn said. </p><p>&#8220;It is clear that a profound investigation must be done on this matter,&#8221; he said, &#8220;and I will ensure that we conduct the inquiry so we see whether all the rules were respected.&#8221;</p><p>He added that if it turned out that the use of the instruments was &#8220;not in line with the rules of the time, then of course we would need to take action,&#8221; including requesting information from other member states if necessary. </p><p>Asked at a press conference if Spain, another heavily indebted E.U. state, had been approached by big investment banks with similar ideas about using derivatives, the Spanish economy minister, Elena Salgado, replied: &#8220;No, absolutely not, and if such a proposal had been made it would not have been accepted.&#8221;</p><p>E.U. officials suspect that investment banks may have exploited loopholes in procedures for reporting debt and deficit figures, both of which are central criteria for euro membership. </p><p>Mr Rehn said pointedly that &#8220;the banks themselves should also ask, not least after the financial crisis, if this has been in line with the code of ethics.&#8221;</p><p>It remains unclear what, in addition to the measures already being taken against Greece, Mr. Rehn could do if the answers he gets from Athens are not to his liking. Greece is already facing action by the European Union over its excessive budget deficit, which far exceeds the limit of 3 percent of G.D.P. set by the treaty that established the euro. </p><p>Greece also faces legal proceedings brought by the European Commission, the E.U. executive, over flaws in its statistical reporting.</p><p>The use of complicated derivative swaps by Greece to mask its deficit was not reported to E.U. authorities or to the European Union statistical agency, Eurostat. </p><p>&#8220;Eurostat made a methodological visit to Greece on 15-19 September 2008,&#8221; said Amadeu Altafaj, spokesman for Mr. Rehn. &#8220;At the time the Greek authorities confirmed that, by law, government units could not enter into fictitious derivatives transactions.&#8221;</p><p>On Monday the Greek finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, said that such swaps were legal when Greece used them. He added that they were no longer being used.</p>
