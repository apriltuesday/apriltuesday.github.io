    <p>BERLIN &#8212; Chancellor Angela Merkel will be glad when this year is over. After all the excitement two months ago of getting together her dream coalition of conservatives and the pro-business Free Democrats, there is now great disappointment. The coalition has squandered its time &#8212; squabbling.</p>      <p>The Free Democrats want to quickly introduce lower taxes and reforms, while the conservatives are divided over the issue. As Germany faces its highest level of new debt in its postwar history, Finance Minister Wolfgang Sch&#228;uble, a leading conservative politician, is the only one talking about a radical savings plan. Despite such a bleak prospect for Europe&#8217;s largest economy, the government pushed into law last Friday higher benefits for families and tax cuts worth &#8364;8.5 billion, or $1.2 trillion. They include big tax breaks for hotels.</p><p>Mrs. Merkel may have miscalculated. These tax benefits are deeply unpopular with the public. Recent polls show that people want the debt brought under control and oppose tax cuts for a few sectors. So far, Mrs. Merkel has left it to Mr. Sch&#228;uble to explain the parlous state of Germany&#8217;s finances. She has not even mentioned the word savings, fearing a backlash from voters.</p><p>Wolfgang Bosbach is a legislator and deputy leader of Mrs. Merkel&#8217;s Christian Democratic Union party. He is also one of Mrs. Merkel&#8217;s most loyal supporters. But even he finds it difficult to praise the coalition&#8217;s record. &#8220;I must admit that the coalition has not functioned in any elegant way. Maybe expectations were too high.&#8221;</p><p>Free Democrat legislators are just as critical about the infighting. Back in power after 11 years, the party does not want to be just an obedient junior partner. It wants to make its mark on economic reform policy. But it has been hampered by the squabbling. </p><p>&#8220;What we have found out over the past few weeks is that we are not, after all, the ideal partners for each other,&#8221; said Otto Fricke, the party&#8217;s budget spokesman and a legislator. &#8220;We have not found a way to work with each other because both sides hold very different views about how to introduce reforms,&#8221; he added.</p><p>There is little to boast about foreign policy, either.</p><p>Mrs. Merkel had made climate change one of her major foreign policy themes when she was first elected in 2005, cajoling the Bush administration into taking the environment seriously. But her interest and influence both seem to have waned. </p><p>Indeed, officials say she should have been in her element in the run-up to the Copenhagen summit meeting on climate change, which was widely seen as a failure. But instead of traveling to Brazil and China, delivering lively speeches on the issue or even promoting a clearer and louder European Union stance, Mrs. Merkel remained in Germany, saying little new. Even during the conference, she did not play any significant role. That was left up to the Danish hosts. </p><p>&#8220;There is a real lack of leadership by Merkel,&#8221; said Gerhard Hirscher, political analyst at the conservative-affiliated Hanns Seidel Foundation in Munich. &#8220;There is a lack of ideas too. It is as if Mrs. Merkel has lost interest in foreign policy,&#8221; he added.</p><p>Take Afghanistan, Germany&#8217;s biggest foreign policy headache. Over the past month, Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg, the new conservative defense minister, has had to explain to a skeptical and pacifist public what exactly happened on the night of Sept. 4 in Kunduz, when a German commander on the ground called in NATO aircraft to bomb two tankers that had been hijacked by the Taliban. </p><p>At first, Berlin officials did not want to admit to any civilian casualties. That changed after Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, who is in charge of NATO and U.S. forces in Afghanistan, uncovered the truth: As many as 142 people, among them many civilians, were killed in the attack. </p><p>Mrs. Merkel defended the action before Parliament &#8212; just weeks before the federal election in late September. Neither her conservative bloc nor the Social Democrats who were still in the government at the time wanted to make Afghanistan an election issue.</p><div id="pageLinks"><ul id="pageNumbers"><li> 1 </li><li> <a onClick="s_code_linktrack('Article-MultiPagePageNum2');" title="Page 2" href="/2009/12/24/world/europe/24iht-letter.html?pagewanted=2&_r=5">2</a> </li></ul><a class="next" onClick="s_code_linktrack('Article-MultiPage-Next');"
