ATHENS &mdash; As officials across Europe continued managing the effects of Greece&rsquo;s debt crisis, Greeks returned to the streets of Athens Wednesday to protest pension system overhaul that will cut monthly payments, raise retirement ages and eliminate entitlements.		</p>      <p>
On a balmy day in the capital, several thousand protesters gathered in Klafthmonos Square, known informally as the plaza of the crying civil servant, playing protest songs an chanting pro-worker slogans through a megaphone.		</p><p>
Helen Skiada, a sales manager at a mobile phone company, was dejected by the smaller than expected turnout. But she said that Greece&rsquo;s problems were so great, that people were losing the will to fight. She makes about &euro;1,100 a month, or $1,400, and said she barely makes ends meet. She fears the crumbling economy will mean job cuts, including hers.		</p><p>
&ldquo;We have nothing to look forward to, but we also have no choice but to come out here and fight,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to keep coming out to things, even if I&rsquo;m the only one here.&rdquo;		</p><p>
Another protester, Konstantinos Iliopoulos, who trains security guards, said that Greeks feel that a recession is inevitable and that more austerity measures lie ahead. &ldquo;There&rsquo;s a sense that nothing can be done, that the government will kill us with a thousand spending cuts,&rdquo; he said		</p><p>
The public sector workers&rsquo; union, Adedy, and its private-sector counterpart, GSEE, organized the demonstration to &ldquo;send yet another message of disapproval to our politicians,&rdquo; said Adedy&rsquo;s president, Spyros Papaspyros. &ldquo;First they cut our salaries, and now they want to cut pensions. It&rsquo;s unjust that working people are shouldering such a burden. There have to be better ways to deal with our country&rsquo;s problems.&rdquo;		</p><p>
The issue of pensions is crucial to Nicholas Nissidis, a math student who attended the protest. &ldquo;I'll work until I die, because I have no other choice,&rdquo; he said. He added that he was bitterly opposed to the pension cuts, which he said would leave him no safety net when he retires.		</p><p>
This month, the Greek Parliament approved &euro;24 billion in cost-cutting measures, including freezing public-sector salaries and raising taxes, in order to secure &euro;120 billion in loans from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund.		</p><p>
The I.M.F. had also asked for pension reform as a precondition for the loan. Greece received &euro;5.5 billion from the I.M.F. on Wednesday and on Tuesday asked for &euro;14.5 billion from the E.U. Finance Minister George Papaconstantinou has said that the country will be able to service its debt for the next few months.		</p><p>
But markets remain jittery and so do Greeks, especially after a massive demonstration of more than 100,000 people May 5 turned deadly.		</p><p>
A fringe group of angry young Greeks broke off from the largely peaceful protest and lobbed a petrol bomb into a bank, which caught fire.		</p><p>
The flames suffocated three bank employees, and Prime Minister George Papandreou called their deaths &ldquo;murder.&rdquo;		</p><p>
Around 65 percent of Greeks oppose the latest austerity measures, and 77 percent of them consider them unfair, according to a survey over the weekend by the Greek pollster Public Issue. Most said that special interests, not ordinary Greeks, will benefit from heavy E.U. and I.M.F. involvement in the country&rsquo;s economic affairs.		</p><p>
But Panos Tsakloglou, an economist who studies poverty and economic inequality issues at Athens University of Economics and Business, said that ultimately the wide-ranging reforms to Greece&rsquo;s bloated public sector will increase competitiveness and productivity and create new jobs.		</p><p>
Crucially, the changes to the Greek tax collection system will also mean that the country can recoup at least some of up to &euro;24 billion lost annually to tax evasion, he said.		</p><p>
The new pension bill, which will be debated in Parliament this week, is the most ambitious in generations and will stabilize Greece&rsquo;s anachronistic and inefficient pension system in the long run, said George Pagoulatos, a political economist at Athens University of Economics and Business.		</p><p>
Labor Minister Andreas Loverdos told SKAI, a private television channel, on Wednesday that, without these reforms, the government would run out of money to pay pensions altogether.		</p><p>
But Greeks are, for the moment, focused on the short-term pain of this bill and the other austerity measures.		</p><p>
&ldquo;These are extremely harsh measures; there&rsquo;s no way to overstate that,&rdquo; Pagoulatos said. &ldquo;People are not enjoying this, and they&rsquo;re very angry at the political system that led to this collapse. It&rsquo;s hard to be patient, to give up their wages and pensions, when they see there&rsquo;s no justice.&rdquo;		</p>
