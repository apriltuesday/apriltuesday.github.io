European Union heads of state are to convene on Thursday in Brussels for a routine summit meeting, now certain to be dominated by discussion of how Europe would respond to the Greek debt crisis.		</p><p>
But with Germany resisting any agreement that could be interpreted as a bailout, there appears to be growing acceptance that the I.M.F. will be involved in any new system for aiding Greece or any other euro zone country in financial distress.		</p><p>
European Union officials acknowledge that there is little chance of agreeing on an aid package at the meeting on Thursday, though they hope to secure consensus on the system that would be called upon if the Greeks sought financial assistance.		</p><p>
&ldquo;We need a system in the next few days,&rdquo; said one European diplomat, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the delicacy  of the issue. &ldquo;The leaders cannot leave Brussels without some deal.&rdquo;		</p><p>
Greece has pressed European Union leaders to clarify what kind of aid they would offer to help the country refinance its debt at lower rates than the market is commanding.		</p><p>
Jean-Claude Juncker of Luxembourg, who leads the group of euro zone finance ministers, told a committee of the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_parliament/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about European Parliament" class="meta-org">European Parliament</a> on Monday that joining with the I.M.F.  &ldquo;would not be a scandal if the bilateral aid from the euro zone amounts to the larger share.&rdquo;		</p><p>
&ldquo;I cannot ignore the fact that there are some reasons why the I.M.F. should be included in the solution, but it should be done on the basis of European rules,&rdquo; he said.		</p><p>
This month  Mr. Juncker said there was no need for I.M.F. involvement beyond technical help. His change of heart reflects the difficulty of bringing Germany, the largest economy in the European Union, on board with a purely European solution.		</p><p>
An agreement in principle, struck last week, that euro zone nations would offer bilateral loans if Greece needed them fell apart when Germany appeared to disown the deal, saying that a direct bailout might contravene European Union  and German law.		</p><p>
Last Friday, the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_commission/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about European Commission" class="meta-org">European Commission</a> president, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/b/jose_manuel_barroso/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso." class="meta-per">Jos&eacute; Manuel Barroso</a>, called publicly for European leaders to strike a deal on aid to Greece, arguing that &ldquo;we cannot prolong any further the current situation.&rdquo;		</p><p>
<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/m/angela_merkel/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Angela Merkel." class="meta-per">Angela Merkel</a>, the German chancellor, reiterated on Monday that there was no need to discuss &ldquo;emergency aid&rdquo; at the meeting on Thursday because the Greeks have not asked for money, Reuters reported from Berlin. She appeared not to rule out discussing a rescue plan.		</p><p>
<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/jeanclaude_trichet/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Jean-Claude Trichet." class="meta-per">Jean-Claude Trichet</a>, president of the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_central_bank/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about European Central Bank" class="meta-org">European Central Bank</a>, also stressed that there would be no direct bailout of Greece. &ldquo;We should not mix up subsidies or transfers with nonconcessional loans,&rdquo; he said to the parliamentary committee in Brussels. &ldquo;We can only be talking about loans without any subsidy element.&rdquo;		</p><p>
Mr. Trichet added that assistance would be made available only if there were a severe threat to the Greek economy and therefore to the euro zone.		</p><p>
The fact that Greek borrowing costs were high would not be sufficient, he said.		</p><NYT_CORRECTION_BOTTOM>	<div class="articleCorrection">
