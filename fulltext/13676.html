ATHENS &mdash; Hundreds of demonstrators took to the streets in Greece on Tuesday, unfurling banners over the Acropolis to rail against new austerity measures aimed at helping the debt-ridden country stave off economic disaster.<br /> <br /> Investors took fright across Europe and on Wall Street, sending the euro to a fresh one-year low. A leading indicator of &nbsp;European blue-chip stocks was off more than 3 percent by the end of the day, while the Dow Jones industrial average was down 2 percent in afternoon trading amid persistent worries that Europe's debt crisis would spread.<br /> <br /> At a news conference in Brussels, the Spanish prime minister, Jos&eacute; Luis Rodr&iacute;guez Zapatero, rejected the idea that his country &nbsp;- which is headed into a second year of recession with a soaring budget deficit and an unemployment rate of 20 percent &nbsp;- &nbsp;might also require a Greek-style bailout.<br /> <br /> ''That's something I would not give any credit to,'' Mr. Zapatero said.<br /> ''It is complete madness.''<br /> <br /> But markets did not seem reassured. In Madrid, the IBEX 35 index fell 5.4 percent to close at 9,859.10 points. In Athens, the Athex composite index plunged 6.7 percent to 1,729.68. And in Portugal, whose fiscal position is also regarded as precarious, the PSI general index slid 3.8 percent to 2,485.43.<br /> <br /> ''There is a still a feeling of nervousness around the Greece rescue package and problems in the peripheral economies,'' Giles Watts, head of trading at City Index, told Reuters.<br /> <br /> Earlier in the day, dozens of protesters from the Communist Party broke the locks at the entrance to the Acropolis, the country's most famous tourist attraction, and hung banners saying: ''Peoples of Europe - Rise Up.''<br /> <br /> The Socialist government of Prime Minister George Papandreou on Sunday announced belt-tightening measures intended to save &curren;30 billion, or $39 billion, over the next three years. The plan is part of an effort to clear the way for a &curren;110 billion rescue package from the European Union and the International Monetary Fund aimed at preventing the country from defaulting on its debt.<br /> <br /> The measures, including freezes in public sector salaries, cuts in pensions and higher sales taxes, amount to a cultural revolution in the social contract between state and citizen.<br /> <br /> Public sector workers, including teachers and hospital employees, began striking &nbsp;Tuesday. A nationwide general strike planned for Wednesday aims to bring services like public transport to a halt across the country.<br /> <br /> Some analysts said the strikes could mark the beginning of a long hot summer of social unrest that threatened to unhinge desperately needed economic changes and could undermine the country's recovery by stifling growth.<br /> <br /> But thus far the demonstrations have been largely peaceful and muted by Greek standards, suggesting that a majority of Greeks are resigned to the fact that there is little choice other than to wait and endure		</p>      <p>
