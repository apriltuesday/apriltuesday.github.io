PARIS &mdash; Ten years after the euro, it&rsquo;s still all about Germany, which isn&rsquo;t the way it was supposed to be.		</p>      <p>
In the run-up to the common currency&rsquo;s debut in 1999, the air was thick with talk about harnessing Germany&rsquo;s economic power, then enshrined in the mark. A failure to move toward monetary union would lead only to &ldquo;a preponderant influence of Germany,&rdquo; Val&eacute;ry Giscard d&rsquo;Estaing, the former president of France, said in a 1997 interview in the French daily Le Monde.		</p><p>
Now, as the European Union thrashes out a possible rescue plan for debt-stricken Greece, the importance of Germany has been thrown back into relief. President Nicolas Sarkozy of France can come out and pledge all the support to Greece he wants, but in the end, it&rsquo;s Germany that matters.		</p><p>
This isn&rsquo;t just because it has Europe&rsquo;s most powerful economy and its largest population. It is because Germany has proved to be a paragon of its own virtues: thrift and hard work. That can&rsquo;t help but annoy its more profligate neighbors.		</p><p>
It has been clear for weeks that if Greece is to get any help from Europe, it must persuade Germany first, which is why everyone keeps taking the German population&rsquo;s temperature on the idea of a bailout. The response is overwhelmingly negative. One German magazine put the Greek statue Venus de Milo on its cover, with its middle finger up in the air, under a headline that said &ldquo;Swindlers in the Euro Family.&rdquo;		</p><p>
This kind of hostile reaction has only convinced the Greeks that this crisis is a two-way tug-of-war. Greek politicians have called on Germany to pay compensation for its occupation during World War II. The Venus insult was matched in Athens by a mock-up of the charioteer on top of Berlin&rsquo;s Brandenburg Gate, this one waving a swastika.		</p><p>
The Dutch, French, Italians and other Europeans don&rsquo;t even get an effigy.		</p><p>
Average Germans, who were the euro&rsquo;s most reluctant converts, always had doubts about southern Europe&rsquo;s big spenders. That has added a petulant &ldquo;I-told-you-so&rdquo; element to the political dilemma faced by Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany.		</p><p>
Germany&rsquo;s fiscal situation suffered in the last year, just like everyone else&rsquo;s. However, its deficit &mdash; now 3.3 percent of gross domestic product &mdash; is well below the deficits of Europe&rsquo;s other large economies. With its visceral fear of debt, born during the inflation of the Weimar Republic, Germany took steps to reduce labor costs even before the fiscal crisis, at a time when wages in nearby countries were kept afloat by a debt-fueled boom.		</p><p>
The German approach, helped by continuing demand for high-quality German industrial goods, has helped the country export more than it imports. According to Eurostat, the Luxembourg-based statistics agency, Germany&rsquo;s trade surplus in the first 11 months of 2009 was &euro;122.4 billion, or $166.6 billion, followed by the Netherlands in a distant second place, with &euro;35.4 billion.		</p><p>
That&rsquo;s good news for Germany, less so for many of its E.U. neighbors, where almost two-thirds of Germany&rsquo;s customers live. The tension of these relationships is what is making it so hard for the 16 members of the euro zone to come up with a system of joint economic governance.		</p><p>
The danger is that the Greek crisis could stoke German disenchantment with any plan to more closely bind the European Union or the euro area. In his February outlook, Willem Buiter, chief economist at Citigroup, said this crisis could make the &ldquo;umbilical attachment&rdquo; of Germany&rsquo;s political elite to the European Union &ldquo;a thing of the past.&rdquo;		</p><p>
Yet unraveling existing links and institutions is virtually impossible, according to Jean-Dominique Giuliani, president of the Robert Schuman Foundation, a research center in Paris.		</p><p>
&ldquo;The interests of all the countries are too intertwined,&rdquo; he said.		</p><p>
So that leaves Germany to set the example. &ldquo;There is really no alternative to the path Germany has taken,&rdquo; Axel Weber, president of the Bundesbank &mdash; whom some see succeeding Jean-Claude Trichet as the president of the European Central Bank &mdash; is quoted as saying in &ldquo;The Euro: The Politics of the New Global Currency,&rdquo; by David Marsh.		</p><p>
In other words, the Germans will be vindicated in their long-held view that for the euro to survive, other countries will have to be, well, more German.		</p>
