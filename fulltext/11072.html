<p>BRUSSELS &#8212; Greece&#8217;s deficit-cutting plan is ambitious but achievable, a top European Union official said Monday, while warning that Athens might have to take additional measures to shore up its finances.</p> 
    
 <p>The European Commission is due to publish recommendations Wednesday on Greece&#8217;s austerity plan to reduce a double-digit budget deficit, which is a main reason Greek financial assets have suffered in the markets for weeks.</p><p>Greece&#8217;s financial problems have also provoked talk about a possible bailout by the European Union and fears of a spill-over effect on other weak, heavily indebted countries in the euro zone.</p><p>&#8220;What we are saying to the Greek authorities is, your stability program has established ambitious targets and objectives and we fully endorse these ambitious objectives,&#8221; said Joaqu&#237;n Almunia, the E.U. commissioner for economic and monetary affairs. &#8220;The achievement of these objectives in the coming three years, before the end of 2012, is absolutely necessary. These objectives are achievable, but they are surrounded by risks.&#8221;</p><p>Greece, which faces its biggest fiscal crisis in decades, pledged last month to reduce its budget shortfall to below 3 percent of gross domestic product in 2012 from 12.7 percent in 2009.</p><p>The gap in its public finances has prompted a series of downgrades by rating agencies and unnerved financial markets worried that Athens may not be able to pay its debt obligations. Its debt is expected to reach 120 percent of G.D.P. this year. </p><p>The Socialists, who came to power in October, have presented measures including higher taxes; a freeze on public-sector monthly wages of over &#8364;2,000, or about $2,800; and slower hiring. But the government is wary of cutting deeper, fearing public unrest. Unions have already called strikes for this month.</p><p>A purchasing managers&#8217; index of the manufacturing sector, released Monday, fell to an eight-month low in January, signaling no quick end to Greece&#8217;s first recession in 16 years.</p><p>Greek G.D.P. is forecast to shrink 0.3 percent this year after a 1.2 percent contraction, government forecasts say. </p><p> &#8220;The economic cycle in Greece lags that of the euro zone by at least six months,&#8221; said Nikos Magginas, an economist at the National Bank of Greece. &#8220;At the same time, the poor fiscal situation and the general sense of uncertainty created by market pressures on the servicing of Greece&#8217;s debt are weighing on business confidence and delaying investment decisions.&#8221;</p><div id="authorId"><p>Reuters</p></div>
