WASHINGTON &mdash; Officials from the United States, South Korea, Brazil and other nations urged fellow members of the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/i/international_monetary_fund/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the International Monetary Fund." class="meta-org">International Monetary Fund</a> on Saturday to move forward on a stalled measure to redistribute voting power within the organization.		</p>      <p>
The I.M.F., which only a few years ago found itself defending its relevance, has assumed a new prominence and boosted its lending capacity since the global economic turmoil began in 2007. It extended loans of $2 billion to Latvia and $16 billion to Hungary in 2008, and is now expected to contribute as much as $20 billion to a bailout of debt-stricken Greece.		</p><p>
The wealthiest nations have dominated I.M.F. decision-making since the body was founded in 1944, but voting power, which is based on a system of quotas, has not shifted much in recent decades, despite the rapid growth of economies in Asia, Latin America and elsewhere.		</p><p>
At the fund&rsquo;s spring meetings two years ago, the I.M.F. governing board approved a plan for substantial changes in the voting system.		</p><p>
And last October, the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/g/group_of_20/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about Group of 20." class="meta-org">Group of 20</a> countries endorsed a proposal to redistribute 5 percent of the organization&rsquo;s voting power from the wealthiest countries toward emerging economies &mdash; like those of Brazil, Russia, India and China &mdash; and developing nations.		</p><p>
For the 2008 plan to take effect, 112 countries representing at least 85 percent of total voting power need to accept it. But as of early March only 65 nations, representing about 70 percent of voting power, had signed on.		</p><p>
&ldquo;The goal is to achieve legitimate representation based on countries&rsquo; economic weight in the world,&rdquo; <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/t/treasury_department/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the U.S. Treasury Department." class="meta-org">Treasury</a> Secretary <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/g/timothy_f_geithner/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Timothy F. Geithner." class="meta-per">Timothy F. Geithner</a> said in a statement. &ldquo;The current quota formula, however, falls short of this objective.&rdquo;		</p><p>
Guido Mantega, the Brazilian finance minister, was more blunt in a statement made on behalf of nine countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. &ldquo;Legitimacy has to be the No. 1 issue on the institution&rsquo;s agenda,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;This should have been a core lesson from the crisis. Apparently, it was not clear or loud enough for all, as we keep seeing the issue being either delayed or pushed to the margins of the agenda.&rdquo;		</p><p>
Since 1944, the I.M.F. has been led by an official from Western Europe, and the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/w/world_bank/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about World Bank" class="meta-org">World Bank</a> by an official from the United States &mdash; an arrangement that is increasingly viewed as archaic.		</p><p>
Yoon Jeung-Hyun, the South Korean finance minister, said on Saturday that the fact that nationality has been a factor in the selection of the top I.M.F. officials has had the effect of &ldquo;undermining the legitimacy of their appointment and calling into question the fund&rsquo;s preparedness to modernize.&rdquo; He said he was speaking for 13 Asian and Pacific nations, including Australia and New Zealand.		</p><p>
Representation was not the only concern at the I.M.F. spring meetings on this weekend. Mr. Geithner called for global coordination to speed economic recovery, overhaul <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/topics/reference/timestopics/subjects/c/credit_crisis/financial_regulatory_reform/index.html?inline=nyt-classifier" title="More articles about financial regulatory reform." class="meta-classifier">financial regulations</a> and combat terrorist financing and money laundering.		</p><p>
<a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/s/dominique_strausskahn/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Dominique Strauss-Kahn." class="meta-per">Dominique Strauss-Kahn</a> of France, the I.M.F.&rsquo;s managing director, has expressed support for various reforms, particularly in financial regulation, and has endorsed the 5 percent shift in voting power.		</p><p>
Greece&rsquo;s finance minister, George Papaconstantinou, met here Saturday with Mr. Strauss-Kahn, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/t/jeanclaude_trichet/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Jean-Claude Trichet." class="meta-per">Jean-Claude Trichet</a>, the governor of the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_central_bank/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about European Central Bank" class="meta-org">European Central Bank</a>, and Olli Rehn, the <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/organizations/e/european_union/index.html?inline=nyt-org" title="More articles about the European Union." class="meta-org">European Union</a>&rsquo;s commissioner for economic and financial affairs.		</p><p>
Mr. Geithner, who took part in the meetings, &ldquo;encouraged them to move quickly to put in place a package of strong reforms and substantial concrete financial support&rdquo; for Greece, the Treasury Department said in a statement.		</p><p>
Also on Saturday, officials from Canada, Japan and the United States joined the World Bank&rsquo;s president, <a href="http://topics.nytimes.com/top/reference/timestopics/people/z/robert_b_zoellick/index.html?inline=nyt-per" title="More articles about Robert B. Zoellick." class="meta-per">Robert B. Zoellick</a>, to call for a significant increase in foreign aid &mdash; currently estimated at less than $300 million a year &mdash; to combat malnutrition. Hunger causes the deaths of up to 3 million mothers and young children a year, they said.		</p><NYT_CORRECTION_BOTTOM>	<div class="articleCorrection">
