<h1>Hi there!</h1>
<div class="blurb">
  <p>I'm a second-year PhD student in computer science, currently on leave from the <a href="https://www.cs.washington.edu/">University of Washington</a>. My research interests are broadly in machine learning, both theoretical foundations and applications. Recently I've been thinking a lot about active/interactive ML, data visualization, and bridging the gap between people and their data.</p>

  <p>While at UW, I worked with <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~guestrin/">Carlos Guestrin</a> and <a href="http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~kemelmi/">Ira Kemelmacher-Shlizerman</a> on projects in machine learning and computer vision. Hence I'm affiliated with the new MODE lab for machine learning and statistics, as well as the <a href="http://grail.cs.washington.edu/">GRAIL</a> lab for graphics and vision.</p>
  
  <p>Previously I was an undergraduate at <a href="http://www.williams.edu/">Williams College</a> (class of 2013), where I majored in mathematics and computer science, and completed an <a href="files/thesis2013.pdf">honors thesis</a> in machine learning.</p>
